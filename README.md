# Advent of Code 2023
My attempts for the [2023 Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2023). (If I ever get around to it...)

So it has been a year since I used Advent of Code 2022 to learn Rust. I have not practiced since. It is very likely that I am not using the best practices.

Each of these folders contains a subfolder and a README file. Within each of the named folders, among other things, there is a source folder with my code, an 'input' file with my puzzle input, and a 'test_input' file with the example input given in the puzzle description. Sometimes there will be a separate 'part1.rs' file which solves the first part of the problem. In those cases, 'main.rs' only solves Part 2 of the problem.

*Note*: Some of my solutions might only work on input files that have carriage return ('\r') characters, as I solved these on Windows. My apologies. It should be easy enough to change by removing any mention of such characters.
